# GithubProjects

I developed a website that uses Express to design a backend server that fetches data from Git Hub using their APIs. The server then responds with specific data when called from the frontend code. For the front end of my app, I used React to design an interface for a user where they will be able to search any user that has opened an account on Git Hub and will display their information relating to their repos.
